## API model(interface) != Data model(implementation)
because think remote control(tv) and their inside devise and the ui of the remote, we may continuesly can change the inside the remote devise but most of time we keep the ui design that is why we need to keep separatly
## In API model we can create customize fields such as to calculate the task based on the given unit price for the Data(django) model
